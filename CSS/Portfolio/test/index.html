                            Hello! I'm an extremely driven and creative Full Stack Developer
                            who is currently open for career opportunities as a front-end or
                            back-end web developer in the Greater Seattle Area.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm a recent graduate of Coding Dojo, a coding school located in
                            Bellevue, WA that teaches 3 full stacks in 3 months. I'm capable
                            of learning new technologies very quickly, and am always looking
                            for opportunities to further expand my skills and grow as a
                            developer.
